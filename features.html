                <button class="accordion">Can I use Hike POS with touch screens?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p><br>Yes, surely you can. Hike can be used on any computer or device with internet connection and a
                        browser. Hike is also available on a native iPad app downloadable from iTunes store.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Why Hike is a lot cheaper compared to its competition? Are there any hidden
                    costs?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p><br>Let’s just say that Hike is not cheaper, it is more cost-effective. Normally, a cheaper product
                        would come with a catch, features limitation or hidden costs. None of these apply to Hike. So,
                        Hike is surely an efficient, feature-packed and a cost-effective option compared to its
                        competition.</p>

                <button class="accordion">I am currently using another system. Is it easy to migrate my products and
                    customer data to Hike?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p><br>Migration from another system to Hike is very easy. You’ll simply export your customer and
                        products data from your existing system and import that in Hike with Hike’s bulk-import feature.
                        For example, if you are currently using a system like Vend, Retail Express, Shopify or Light
                        Speed, you can export your data from those systems. If you require, we also offer free help with
                        data migration. Simply contact our support team and they will have you up and running on Hike in
                        no time!</p>
